Hi, I’m @ParadiseLoop (Daniel),

Hi, I’m Daniel, a Data Engineer passionate about the complexities of technology and how the ways it shapes our present!

I love squeezing my brains around some code and try to figure out how it all works;

I am a master at failing, and I'm here to learn :)

Please reach me out on danielrou0101gmail.com for collaborations;

Ad astra per aspera
